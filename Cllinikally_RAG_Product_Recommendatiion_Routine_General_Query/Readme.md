4) A ppt for quick overview



To quick run the file,(using already created preprocessed data and embeddings)
1)Open quick run folder
2) Upload the files in dependencies folder( 3 Embeddings files(embeddings_Description.npy, embeddings_Tags.npy, embeddings_Description_and_Tags.npy) and 1 csv file containing preprocessed data (preprocessed_useful_data.csv)
3) start running the cells from the Cell with Title "For quick Run, Start here"


For start to end(preprocessing your own data and creating your own embeddings
1)upload useful_data.csv (full run folder).
2)start with preprocessing cells
2)Create embeddings. the code is commented out and gpu optimised. It has two versions and the second one is faster.
3) Run all the cells below it.( basically after this it is similar to quick run,b but you have created your own dependencies files)
